# SQL Query Optimization Framework

## Overview
This Python framework demonstrates how to optimize SQL queries for large datasets using techniques such as indexing, partitioning, and query rewriting. It allows users to benchmark the performance of unoptimized queries versus optimized ones, providing clear comparisons and insights.

The framework can be applied to various databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) and is designed to help data scientists and engineers optimize their queries for performance in large-scale data environments.

## Features
- **Query Execution**: Run SQL queries and return results in a DataFrame.
- **Indexing**: Create indexes on columns to improve query performance.
- **Partitioning**: Partition tables by a specific column to enhance query execution on large datasets.
- **Query Optimization**: Automatically apply common optimizations such as limiting data retrieval or simplifying queries.
- **Explain Plans**: Analyze the execution plan of queries to understand performance bottlenecks.
- **Benchmarking**: Compare the execution times of original and optimized queries.
